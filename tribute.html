            <li>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,<br>the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li>
            <li>He was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party<br> and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.</li>
            <li>Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public<br>service after a single term.</li>
            <li>He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</li>
            <li>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from<br>an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.</li>
